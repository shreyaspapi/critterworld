## Problem Statement ##
In an exam, some questions are to place certain options in order. For example, in History, battles may be asked to place in chronological order. However, if the students are off by even one in their answers, they receive 0 points! For example, if a-c-b and the student submits c-b-a or c-a-b, he will receive 0!
Surely there must be a better way! If the number of correct pairs are counted, the student will score more but the total marks would increase to [n * (n-1) / 2]. How about checking the maximum number of correct pairings? For example, in the submission above, the student would receive 2 in both cases! This seems nice.
Given the correct order of options as a string, calculate the score of n students for each of their submissions.

## Input Format ##
First line: t test cases
For next 2t lines:
solution n
submissions * n separated by a single space

## Constraints ##
1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
1 ≤ n ≤ 100
1 ≤ |solution| = |submission| ≤ 25

## Output Format ##
A single line per test case containing n scores separated by a single space
